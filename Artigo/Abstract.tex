\textbf{Abstract: }
One of the biggest difficulties in working with football match predictions is the lack of standardization of existing databases, and the purpose of this project is to standardize the databases according to what the user wants. The databases used are of the .csv format. The visualization of such information is the subject of several other projects, which is also the focus of this, where the software aims at standardization of the data and will also allow the user to compile this data, design it and facilitate the visualization of the compiled data, providing thus, a materialized visualization tool.\\
