\textbf{Abstract: }
One of the greatest difficulties in working with predictions of football matches is the lack of standardization of existing databases. The purpose of this project is to standardize the databases according to the user's preferences. This standardization occurs through the created software, which displays the data present in the database and allows the user to choose which characteristics will be used for the creation of the standardized database. After standardization, the data is compiled, thus providing a unique visualization tool.
